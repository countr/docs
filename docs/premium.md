## How to support

We have multiple ways on how you can support us, and for this reason we have made a credits system. The credits system adds up all your monthly donations, so if you donate $3 somewhere and $2 somewhere else, it will give you all $5 features. (more about this below)

You can currently support us in two ways: [on Patreon](https://patreon.com/promises) or through Nitro boosts in our server. If you have a Nitro subscription including boosts, and don't know what to do with them, you can gain $2 by boosting our server. That will give you all $1 features. And if you donate another dollar on Patreon directly to us, you have all $3 features.

> [!WARNING]
> - You must be in the support server to get your rewards, this is due to our automated credits system.
> - You must have connected your Discord to Patreon to get your Patreon-rewards. Get help from [this guide](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-Get-my-Discord-role#h_21f22930-84c5-4950-b6b1-3e83312f66dc) made by Patreon themselves.
> - No refunds are accepted, especially Nitro boosts as these doesn't directly support us but rather the Discord server.
> - The owner of the server must be the one donating.

> [!NOTE]
> - All Premium features are only accessible through the Premium bot.
> - It can take up to five minutes for the bot to be available.
> - If you move from the Premium bot to Countr, or vica versa, you will still keep the data for the server. They are both connected to the same database, so all data is still being stored. Don't panic!
