# Countr

Countr is an advanced counting bot which can manage a counting channel in your guild. It's very simple to add it to your server:

1. Add the bot with [this invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=467377486141980682&permissions=805334032&scope=bot%20applications.commands).
2. Do `c!setup`, or link a pre-existing channel with `c!link <channel>` and `c!set <count>`.
3. Count in the counting channel.

Yeah, it's actually that simple to set up. *mic drop* ðŸŽ¤

## Purpose

There is a lot of multi-purpose bots out there, some of them may also include a simple counting setup. What's wrong about multi-purpose is that they're focused on so many things that some of the features are poorly executed and very limited. Countr is not multi-purpose, it's only focused on counting. This means Countr has much more counting features than other bots.

Countr has a simple setup but also has cool advanced features, such as modules, flows and more.
