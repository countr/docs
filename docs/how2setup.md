# Quick setup

Setting up Countr is very easy actually, just do `c!autosetup` and you're done! ...yes, that is actually it. As long as it has enough permissions, this should work.

## Manual setup

If you already have a counting channel made, or the autosetup didn't work properly, you can link it manually by doing `c!link` inside the counting channel. After that, you can do `c!set <channel>`. (optional)
